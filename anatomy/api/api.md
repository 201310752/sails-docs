# api/

This folder contains the vast majority of your app's back-end logic.  It is home to the 'M' and 'C' in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">MVC Framework</a>.

In it you will find the following:

- Controllers: [Actions and controllers](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) contain back-end logic that handles incoming requests (like form submissions).
- Helpers: [Helpers](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers) are shared functions that can be called from anywhere in your app.
- Models: [Models](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm) are the structures that contain data for your Sails App.
- Policies: [Policies](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/policies) are middleware that restrict access to certain actions in your app.

You may also find these folders, which are not always generated by default in new Sails apps:

- Responses: [Custom responses](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/custom-responses) can help maintain consistent HTTP status codes and behavior across your app.  (Since not every Sails application needs to define its own custom responses, this folder is sometimes excluded.)
- Services: [Services](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/services) are shared utilities common in Sails apps written before version 1.0.  They can be _just about anything_, so for new apps, it's recommended that you use [helpers](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers) instead.
